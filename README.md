What started as a basic HTML assignment has turned into something I'm genuinely excited about. This bakery website now has proper JavaScript interactivity, forms that actually work, and it's optimized for search engines. Basically, it's gone from "student project" to "something I'd actually show a potential employer."

## 🚀 Part 3 Enhanced Features

### Interactive Elements That Actually Work
- **Pop-up Modals:** Click on team members or products for detailed info - no more boring static pages

- **Tabbed Navigation:** Switch between content without page reloads - surprisingly satisfying to use
- **Image Gallery:** Click any product photo for a full-screen view with arrow key navigation
- **Smooth Animations:** Everything moves nicely instead of just popping in and out

### Search That Actually Finds Things
- **Live Search:** Type in the search box and watch results update instantly - no submit button needed
- **Filter Buttons:** Click bread, pastries, etc. to filter products (way easier than scrolling through everything)
- **Smart Results:** It finds partial matches and even handles typos pretty well
- **Clean Interface:** No cluttered dropdowns or confusing menus - just simple, obvious controls

### Maps That Don't Make You Want to Cry
- **Three Locations:** All our bakery spots with proper Google Maps integration
- **Easy Switching:** Click buttons to jump between locations - no need to zoom and pan around
- **Useful Info:** Store hours, contact details, parking info - stuff people actually want to know
- **Phone Friendly:** Works just as well on mobile as desktop (surprisingly tricky to get right)

### Enhanced Forms & Validation
- **Comprehensive Contact Form:** Real-time validation with professional error handling
- **Advanced Enquiry System:** Detailed forms for custom orders, catering, and special requests
- **Smart Validation:** Email, phone, and field-specific validation with user feedback
- **Professional Processing:** Loading animations and confirmation messages

### Complete SEO Optimization
- **Title Tags:** Unique, keyword-optimized titles for every page
- **Meta Descriptions:** Compelling descriptions with clear value propositions
- **Image Alt Text:** Detailed, accessibility-friendly descriptions for all images
- **Technical SEO:** Proper URL structure, canonical tags, and meta optimization

## What I Built

This website represents the complete journey from Part 1 through Part 3, creating a sophisticated bakery website for "Flour Crust" that combines beautiful design with advanced functionality. Every feature has been crafted to provide real business value while demonstrating mastery of modern web development techniques.

## 📱 How It Looks on Different Devices

### Mobile Version
![Mobile Screenshot](images/mobile.view.png)

I'm really happy with how the responsive design turned out. It was challenging getting all the breakpoints right, but now it adapts smoothly to any screen size.
## How to View My Website

# Part 2 - The Real Work Begins!

## Oops - I Messed Up the Repository Thing

**So here's what happened...** I originally put this whole project in the Part 1 repository because I didn't read the instructions properly (classic student mistake, right?). My lecturer pointed this out and I had to move everything to the proper Part 2 repository. 

It was actually a pain to migrate everything, but at least now it's organized correctly and shows that this is Part 2 work with all the responsive design and advanced CSS stuff.

### Screenshots as Proof (Because My Lecturer Asked For Them!)

#### My Git Commit History
![Git Log Screenshot](https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-part-2-Qwen37/raw/master/screenshots/git-log-proof.png)
*Look at all these commits - I've been working on this project for weeks!*

**Some of my commit messages (yes, I got creative with emojis):**
- `f751a84` - When I finally learned IIE Harvard referencing format
- `5d6f354` - Fixed that awful navigation visibility issue (so embarrassing)
- `2d3ba18` - Moved screenshots to the right section (organization matters!)
- `657ec6c` - Got the images working properly on GitHub
- `e1c6f92` - Changed from boring SVG to actual food photos

#### Proof I Moved Repositories
![Remote URL Proof](https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-part-2-Qwen37/raw/master/screenshots/remote-url-proof.png)
*This shows I'm now in the Part 2 repo where I should be*

#### All My Project Files  
![File Structure](https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-part-2-Qwen37/raw/master/screenshots/project-structure.png)
*Everything organized and ready for marking*

**What's in my project:**
- 5 HTML pages (took forever to get the navigation right)
- Over 27,000 bytes of CSS (probably too much, but it works!)
- JavaScript that actually does stuff (form validation, interactive elements)
- Real bakery photos I found (way better than placeholder images)
- This very long README file you're reading right now

**Git Log Proof:** Multiple descriptive commits demonstrate continuous development and proper version control practices:
```
* f751a84 📚 Update references to IIE Harvard style and add repository migration explanation
* 5d6f354 🎨 Fix navigation visibility and implement consistent bakery color scheme
* 2d3ba18 📱 Move responsive design screenshots to Part 2 section
* 657ec6c 📸 Add responsive design screenshots and fix README image URLs
* e1c6f92 🥐 Replace croissant SVG with actual puff pastry photo on homepage
```

**Repository URLs:**
- Original (Part 1): `https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-part-1-Qwen37`
- Current (Part 2): `https://github.com/VCWVL/wede5020-part-2-Qwen37`

## What I Had to Fix After Part 1 Feedback

Honestly, I made quite a few mistakes in Part 1 that I had to learn from. Here's what my lecturer pointed out and how I fixed it:

### The Navigation Nightmare  
**The Problem:** My navigation text was basically invisible - white text on white background. Not my brightest moment!

**How I Fixed It:**
- Changed the text color to a proper dark color so you can actually see it
- Added a semi-transparent background behind the text
- Went with a brown bakery theme that makes sense for the site
- Made the hover effects actually work properly this time
- Spent way too much time in the CSS file fixing this mess

### Color Scheme Chaos
**The Problem:** My colors were all over the place - looked like a rainbow threw up on my website

**How I Fixed It:**
- Picked a proper bakery color scheme (browns and golds) and stuck with it
- Made sure every button, link, and hover effect uses the same colors
- Actually looks professional now instead of like a 5-year-old designed it

### Repository Mix-Up
**The Problem:** I accidentally put everything in the Part 1 repo when it should have been Part 2

**How I Fixed It:**
- Moved everything to the proper Part 2 repository (took forever!)
- Added notes explaining my mistake so it doesn't look like I did it on purpose
- Made sure all the documentation is correct now
- **Files Modified:** `README.md`, git remote configuration

#### **4. Academic Referencing Standards**
**Problem Identified:** References not in IIE Harvard format
**Solution Implemented:**
- Converted all references to proper IIE Harvard style
- Added access dates and full URL citations
- Expanded reference list with additional academic sources
- **Files Modified:** `README.md` (References section)

#### **5. Responsive Design Documentation**
**Problem Identified:** Missing visual proof of responsive design
**Solution Implemented:**
- Added responsive design screenshots (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Organized screenshots under Part 2 section for proper academic categorization
- Updated image URLs to work properly on GitHub
- **Files Modified:** `README.md`, added `mobile.view.png`, `tablet.View.png`, `desktop.View.png`

### Technical Improvements Made

#### **CSS Enhancements:**
- Fixed navigation button visibility with proper contrast ratios
- Implemented consistent bakery-themed color scheme
- Added professional hover effects and transitions
- Enhanced responsive design with better media queries

#### **Image Optimization:**
- Updated croissant section to use actual pastry photos instead of SVG placeholders
- Added vanilla custard slice image to About page values section
- Ensured all images use relative paths for GitHub compatibility
- Added comprehensive alt text for accessibility

#### **Code Organization:**
- Implemented proper semantic HTML5 structure
- Added comprehensive comments and documentation
- Organized CSS with clear section divisions
- Maintained clean, professional code standards

### Repository History and Commits
Multiple descriptive commits demonstrate continuous development:
```
* f6e3359 📸 Add screenshot evidence documentation for repository migration

* 2d3ba18 📱 Move responsive design screenshots to Part 2 section
