## Honest Academic Declaration

I built this website following IIE's academic integrity rules - basically, I'm being upfront about where I learned stuff and what inspired my code. Everything's properly referenced using Harvard style because that's what they want, and honestly, it's good practice to keep track of your sources.

Look, I didn't reinvent the wheel here. Web development is all about learning from others and building on existing knowledge. But I made sure to understand everything I used and put my own spin on it.

## Where I Actually Learned This Stuff

### The Books and Websites That Saved Me

**Duckett, J.** (2014). *JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development*. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley.
- **What I used it for:** Learning how to actually manipulate the DOM and handle events properly
- **Where you'll see it:** The modal pop-ups, accordion menus, and form validation - basically anywhere JavaScript is doing something interactive

**Mozilla Developer Network** (2025). *JavaScript Documentation*. [online] Available at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript [Accessed 3 November 2025].
- **What I used it for:** Figuring out modern JavaScript syntax and checking browser compatibility
- **Where you'll see it:** All over the place - this site was my constant companion for ES6 features and making sure my code would work in different browsers

### CSS & Design Implementation
Responsive design principles implemented following:

**Marcotte, E.** (2011). *Responsive Web Design*. New York: A Book Apart.
- Applied in: Mobile-first approach, flexible grid systems

## The Stuff I Actually Wrote Myself

Here's what I built from scratch (with some help from the sources above):

1. **The Pop-up Modals** (`script.js` around lines 45-120)
   - I wrote this whole system for showing product details and team info
   - Added keyboard controls (ESC to close, arrow keys to navigate) because I hate websites that trap you

2. **Real-Time Search** (`script.js` around lines 250-350)  
   - Built my own search algorithm that updates as you type
   - The category filtering buttons were trickier than I expected but I'm happy with how they turned out

3. **Image Gallery Lightbox** (`script.js` around lines 180-240)
   - Made this from scratch because I wanted something that worked exactly how I envisioned
   - Added touch support for mobile users (swipe to navigate) which took forever to get right

4. **Smart Form Validation** (`script.js` around lines 400-500)
   - Real-time validation that doesn't annoy users but still catches errors
   - Custom error messages that actually help instead of just saying "invalid input"

5. **The Entire CSS Framework** (`styles.css` - all 2600+ lines)
   - Built my own responsive system from the ground up
   - All the animations and transitions are custom-made (probably spent too much time on these)

## Learning Acknowledgments

This project demonstrates learning outcomes achieved through:

- **Course Materials:** WEDE5020 lecture content and assignment briefs
- **Academic Texts:** Referenced books and academic papers
- **Industry Standards:** W3C specifications, browser documentation
- **Best Practices:** Professional development guidelines and accessibility standards

## My Promise That I Did This Honestly

Alright, here's my official statement:

1. **This is my work** - I built this website myself, though obviously I learned from the sources I've listed
2. **I've cited everything** - If I learned something from somewhere else, I've mentioned it
3. **No copy-pasting** - I didn't just steal code from Stack Overflow (though I definitely visited it a few times for inspiration)
4. **Solo project** - This was all me, no group work to worry about
5. **Fresh submission** - Haven't turned this in anywhere else

This project shows what I've actually learned in WEDE5020. Sure, I looked stuff up and followed tutorials, but I understand how it all works and made it my own.

*Look, web development is collaborative by nature - we all learn from each other. This document just makes it official that I've been honest about my sources and done the work myself. The website works, it looks good, and I can explain every part of it because I built it step by step.*
