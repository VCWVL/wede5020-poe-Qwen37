## Course Materials

*Note: All web-based sources were accessed on 3 November 2025. This reference list follows the Harvard referencing style as required by The Independent Institute of Education academic standards.*

*Note: I checked all these websites on 3 November 2025 - some of them I probably visited way too many times while working on this project! Following Harvard referencing because that's what IIE wants, and honestly it's good practice for keeping track of where I learned stuff.*

**Real talk:** This project taught me that there's SO much more to web development than I thought when I started. Every time I thought I was done, I'd find another cool feature to add or realize I was doing something the hard way. These resources above are the ones that actually helped me figure things out - not just the ones that look good in a bibliography!
